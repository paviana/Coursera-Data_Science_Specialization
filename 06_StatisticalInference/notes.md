### Peer 1 

Overall the submission is a decent one. The first part of the assignment is written well and covers all topics needed. It only lacks a simple visualization of the distribution to get an impression before any analysis being performed. The second part of the course project is relatively short, though it answers the Basic questions. A further analysis and testing is suggested, f.e. testing the impact factors independently (OJ vs VC, ignoring the dosage).

### Peer 2

CLT Report: Nice job. The formulas looked very nice in the report. Maybe a little more description of q-q plots would have been helfpul. I was not familiar with that type of plot and I don't remember seeing it in the slides. I googled it online and it looks like a very good tool for evaluating normality here. Tooth Growth: I was unable to give credit for the confidence intervals and hypothesis tests because I didn't see any confidence intervals or hypothesis tests. There was only linear regression modeling which is not covered in the course. I didn't see anything stating the assumptions. I'm guessing this analysis was correct but it unfortunately didn't meet the rubric. The animals used in the test were guinea pigs not pigs. Guinea pigs are small rodents as opposed to pigs. It seems like a small difference but for a published report it would not be good to mistake the animals used for the experiment.

### Peer 3

part 1, the author has demonstrated well in using a graph to summarise the sample mean vs theoretical mean. Well done ! part 2, the graph depicted a well representation of co-relationship between the 2 supplements and the tooth length. However the answer fall short of providing a summary for conclusion and assumption

### Peer 4

The explanations in the reports were clear and easy to understand. Appropriate mathematical models were also used to help people to better understand the problem. The length of the report has met the target of 3 pages. Also, the structure of the report is quite clear. Overall, it was a good attempt.
